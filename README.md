# Metadata Printer

Simple server to allow students to see the metadata from their projects.

Written in Flask and using requests_html to acquire the metadata.

## Usage

Supply the URL of the live server followed by the URL you wish to check, for example:

https://ci-metaprinter.herokuapp.com/https://mattrudge.net

If everything works correctly, you will be returned to a page with a list of the `meta` element attributes
